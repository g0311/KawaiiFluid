# Kawaii Fluid

Welcome to the **Kawaii Fluid** documentation. This is a custom SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) fluid simulation plugin designed for Unreal Engine 5.7.

## Features

*   **Custom SPH Solver:** High-performance fluid simulation logic.
*   **Subsystem-based Management:** Global coordination via `UKawaiiFluidSimulatorSubsystem`.
*   **Modular Components:** Easily attach simulation capabilities to any Actor.
*   **Niagara Integration:** Visual feedback powered by Unreal Engine's Niagara VFX system.

## Project Structure

This project demonstrates fluid systems in three different game variants:
1.  **Combat:** Interaction in action-oriented scenarios.
2.  **Platforming:** Physics-based puzzles and movement.
3.  **SideScrolling:** Classic 2D/3D hybrid fluid interaction.
